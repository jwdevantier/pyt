## Project Status

This is still an experimental project. A rough gauge of stability would be:

* Snippet: 80%
* Specs: 80%
    * Pretty confident in overall API
    * Minor adjustments based on Clojure could be made
* Template DSL: 60%
    * Need more testing to determine potential pitfalls/shortcomings
* Writer: 95%
    * Based off of an existing idea, feel pretty confident of its usefulness
