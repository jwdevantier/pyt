# Writer

The writer interface is inspired by [Picocog](https://github.com/ainslec/picocog), a small Java-based code-generator. The writer interface solves two problems compared the raw, `print()`-style interface of snippets.

1. Indenting and dedenting lines
2. Sections - allowing the code to write in multiple places of the output

## Example use

```python

```
